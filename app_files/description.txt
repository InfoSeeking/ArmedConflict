This is the first iteration of the ACAP website, which shows the basic layout of what the site should look like: 
     a basic intro for the project
     a section for a layed choropleth map
     and a section for rate of change charts (not completed)
The python code used is code1.py, a very bare-bones version of a choropleth map.
The app can be seen by running flask on cmd. Set the FLASK_APP=main.py and run flask. The demo should run on your browswer.
